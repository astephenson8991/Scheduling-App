Scheduling App - A School Project
Description
This repository contains the source code for the Scheduling App, a project developed as part of my coursework during my degree. The primary goal of this application was to build a functional system capable of managing schedules, appointments, or tasks. This project provided a practical opportunity to apply concepts learned in class, including software design principles, data management, and potentially user interface development.

Features

User Authentication: Allowing users to create accounts and log in.

Event Creation: The ability to add new appointments, tasks, or events with details like title, date, time, and description.

Viewing Schedule: Displaying scheduled items in a clear format (e.g., a calendar view, list view).

Editing and Deleting Events: Functionality to modify or remove existing schedule entries.

Conflict Detection: (Potentially) Logic to identify and alert users about scheduling conflicts.

Data Persistence: Storing schedule data, likely in a database.

Lessons Learned
Developing the Scheduling App was a valuable educational experience. It allowed me to solidify my understanding of several key concepts and practical skills:

Applying Core Programming Concepts: I gained hands-on experience implementing fundamental programming principles, data structures, and algorithms in a real-world context.

Database Design and Interaction: This project involved designing a database schema to store scheduling information and learning how to interact with the database from the application code (e.g., using SQL or an ORM).

Handling Date and Time Data: Working with dates, times, and time zones presented specific challenges and taught me how to correctly manage and manipulate temporal data.

User Interface Development: (If applicable) I learned the basics of building a user interface, connecting front-end elements to back-end logic, and creating a user-friendly experience.

Problem Solving and Debugging: Identifying and fixing bugs, especially those related to scheduling logic or database interactions, significantly improved my debugging and problem-solving abilities.

Project Structure and Organization: Managing the different components of the application (UI, logic, data layer) helped me understand the importance of good project structure and code organization.

Version Control with Git: Using Git and GitHub for this project reinforced my understanding of version control, branching, committing, and managing project history.

Understanding Application Architecture: I gained insight into how different parts of an application communicate and work together, from the user interface to the data storage.

This project was instrumental in bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, providing a solid foundation for future development work.
